# Embeddings directory

This is our embeddings directory containing the embeddings for a benchmark in separate directories.
We always tried to append a suffix to an embedding directory describing the model used for training in favor of our evaluation scripts (i.e. '\_rescal', '\_transe', '\_transh', ...).

## Our embeddings

Because of the size and number of embeddings we experimented with, we will gladly provide them (currently only) on request.
